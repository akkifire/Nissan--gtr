	<h2 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p id="p1">The GF-BNR34 (R34) Skyline GT-R, GT-R V·Spec and GT-R V·Spec N1 models were released in January 1999. The R34 GT-R was also shorter (from front to rear), and the front overhang reduced. The valve covers were painted glossy red (colour code Cherry Red Effect Z24 or X1020), as opposed to black in previous models.</p></div>

	<h2 align="center">FEATURES</h2>
	<p id="p2">A new feature on the R34 GT-R is a 5.8" LCD multifunction display on the center of the dashboard, which shows seven different live readings of engine and vehicle statistics such as turbocharger pressure (1.2 bar max), oil and water temperature, among others. The GT-R V·Spec model added two extra features to the display: intake and exhaust gas temperatures. Nismo Multi-function Displays (MFD) can be bought at an extra cost, they include a lap timer, G-Force meter and an increase in boost pressure measurement to 2 bar. The R34 GT-R was made shorter in response to customer concerns who thought the R33 was too bulky.</p>

	<p>The Nissan GT-R (Japanese: 日産・GT-R, Nissan GT-R), is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, unveiled in 2007.[4][5][6] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The GT-R is built on the PM platform, which is derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and the Nissan Z models.</p>

		<h2 align="center">ABOUT NISSAN</h2>
		<p>Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. (Japanese: 日産自動車株式会社, Hepburn: Nissan Jidōsha kabushiki gaisha), often shortened to Nissan,[a] is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The company sells its vehicles under the Nissan and Infiniti brands, and formerly the Datsun brand, with in-house performance tuning products (including cars) labelled Nismo. The company traces back to the beginnings of the 20th century, with the Nissan zaibatsu, now called Nissan Group.

		 Since 1999, Nissan has been part of the Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance (Mitsubishi joining in 2016), a partnership between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, with Renault of France. Renault holds a 43.4% voting stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in Renault. Following an agreement in January 2023, Renault is set to reduce its voting stake to 15%, making both manufacturers equal in voting rights.[6] Since October 2016 Nissan holds a 34% controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors.[7]
